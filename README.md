This is my personal repository containing my work on assigments for the Game Dev Course @ FMI 2020 Edition. Every one of the projects here is either a homework or the final project. My work here landed me the opurtunity to be a teaching asistant of the course in the next iterations. 

## Main repository of the course

## Final Project - Project name Knight's Vow

It's a roguelike game barely a clone of the famous 'The Binding of Isaac'. The game has win and lose condition, action bar and simple UI. AI enemies based on radar sense, which means that if the Player enters their zone of attention, the enemy will rush towards them. The game was made to display the concept of Procedural Generated Content - The dungeon is generated also the position of the enemies and other items like potions. More information for the implementation will be displayed in the Final Project's README
