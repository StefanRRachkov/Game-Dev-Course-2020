# Game Dev Course 2020

This is my personal repository containing my work on assigments for the Game Dev Course @ FMI 2020 Edition. Every one of the projects here is either a homework or the final project. My work here landed me the opurtunity to be a teaching asistant of the course in the next iterations.
